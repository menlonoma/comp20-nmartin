Readme for Messages Lab
Nolan Martin -- 10.21.15

1. All aspects have been correctly implemented to my knowledge. No CSS formatting was added, only standard HTML unorderedlist formatting is used. The code was left in the format which uses the herokuapp JSON, not the data.json JSON.

2. I have not collaborated or discussed this lab with anyone.

3. I have spent approximately 1.5 hours on this assignment.

4. Additional question: It appears that both of these actions are possible because the <script> tag does not obey the same origin policy. Can't say I'm terribly confident but would love to learn the right answer.
