Captain's Log Lab - COMP20
Nolan Martin - 11.3.15

1. All aspects of the lab have been implemented correctly to my knowledge. Note that an error regarding the character encoding of the HTML document exists in the console; this can be remedied with modification of the HTML but this is not allowed.

2. I have not discussed the assignment with any other students. I was helped by Thomas Colgrove.

3. I have spent approximately 2 hours on the lab.
