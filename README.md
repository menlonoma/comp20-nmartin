COMP20 Lab 9
Nolan Martin

1. This Git repository served as a home for assignments completed for COMP20 - Web Development, taught by Ming Chow at Tufts University in Fall 2015.

2. Assignment 3, the server-side of MapChat, while labor intensive and at first difficult to understand, taught me countless new things about server-side development and left me feeling far more comfortable with Node syntax and usage of MongoDB.

3. After a semester of web development, I feel far more confident in my ability to learn more and teach myself how to continue to improve my web development skills after the course is over; the material seemed daunting on day 1, but having been introduced to the essentials, web development appears to be much more approachable.

4. Echoing my point above, the best thing this course taught me to do was to learn on my own or with my peers; lots of time was spent with TAs and peers working away at assignments, and I can certainly say that those assignments are responsible for the bulk of my learning. Assignments 1 and 3 are good examples of this; on both occasions, the material required to complete them had not been covered in great depth in class, and completing them took patience, an ability to ask questions to TAs and Google, and a willingness to learn outside of class.

5. Having just had a taste of web security with assignment 4, I would love to spend more time learning about vulnerabilities and both exploiting and protecting against them; I find it fascinating that even now, so many mistakes are still made in web development in regards to security, and certainly do not want to make those mistakes myself.
